####Intall via Package Control: 

```
  1. Open Sublime Text 3
  2. cmd+shift+p
  3. Package Control: Install Package
  4. Search for LiveStamps
```

####Manual Install: 

```
  1. Open Sublime Text 3
  2. Sublime Text Menu -> Preferences -> Browse Packages
  3. Create folder called LiveStamps
  4. Copy this repo to the folder.
```



## USAGE:

Just hit a key combo, or select a stamp from the context menu...  Thats it! 

You can see all the default stamps by right clicking and exploring the LiveStamps context menu. Each "livestamp" is handled by regex and will update whenever the document is saved (by default auto_update is set to true). Stamps can also ouput their raw value as static data which is useful for things like the current filename, path, parent folder or time, etc.

####Using keyboard:

```
General Example:
super + alt + letter -> inject a stamp
ctrl  + alt + letter -> inject a stamp's raw value

Example: inject all defined stamps.

super + alt + a                        
ctrl  + alt + a      
```

####Using menu:

```
General:
Right-click > LiveStamps > stamp > stamptype
Right-click > LiveStamps > value > stampvalue
Tools       > LiveStamps > stamp > stamptype
Tools       > LiveStamps > value > stampvalue

Example: inject all available stamps.

Right-click > LiveStamps > stamp > all
Right-click > LiveStamps > value > all
```

#### Using Command Pallete:
```
super+shift+p > type LiveStamps > select a stamp option
```



## Creating Custom Stamps:

Live stamps are defined within the *LiveStamps.sublime-settings* file in JSON format. The best way to learn is by browsing/modifying the default stamp examples, but here are the details if you really want to get into it 8)

**WARNING!**

Regex patterns are powerful expressions!
    
Test your stamp regex online at a site like [www.regexr.com](https://www.regexr.com "Regexr") first!!! An expression that accidentally matches valid code, will instantly replace it. Also, a mistyped pattern that is too "loose" could replace a huge amount of data in a large file, potentially causing data loss...



####Anatomy of a LiveStamp:

```
'value' : REQUIRED List or literal string value. Setting as "auto" tries to find the value for you

'stamp' : REQUIRED Format string. Stamp value(s) are inserted at tag marker(s) i.e. "{0} {1} {2}"

'regex' : OPTIONAL Python regex pattern. If empty/excluded, the stamp is assumed static.

'strft' : OPTIONAL Python strftime() format to apply to a time value i.e. "%d-%m-%Y"

'format': OPTIONAL Python format() to apply to the stamp's value
```



####Basic Static Stamp: 

A stamp with a constant output.

```json
"mystamp": {
  "value": "An important value i use often while programming",
  "stamp": "{0}",
},

Output: 

An important value i use often while programming

```



####"Live" Stamp Example (with time formatting): 

A live updating stamp to insert the current date.

Note the "auto" value, Which tells LiveStamps to grab the current time. A constant Python time value could be entered as the value as well, allowing a static time inputs.

```json
"date": {
  "value": "auto",
  "strft": "%d-%m-%Y",
  "regex": "@date.+",
  "stamp": "@date        {0}",
},

Output: 

@date        08-03-2015
```



####Multi-part "Live" Stamp Example: 

A live updating stamp with multiple values made from other stamps.

This stamp would maintain the date portion automatically for you on save. Note, for this to stamp to auto update the previous "date" stamp example would have to be defined somewhere in the definitions

Note: the order of definitions is **NOT** important

```json
"copyright": {
  "value": ["(c) TundraTech", "date"],
  "regex": "@copyright.+",
  "stamp": "@copyright   {0} {1}",
},

Output:

@copyright   (c) TundraTech 08-03-2015
```

As an exercise, let's examine what happens if the "date" stamp was NOT defined. The output would be assumed to be two static values as so:

```
@copyright   (c) TundraTech date
```

However, the stamp would still be considered "live" because a regex was supplied. 

Because the stamp is still "live", changing either value in the list would instantly update all existing stamps matching the regex within the document, allowing you instantly update the document with a static date or change to a different company name if desired. 

**Note:
Changing the regex would abandon all previously inserted "copyright" stamps, rendering them as static/permanent... Careful!**
