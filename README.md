# LiveStamps for Sublime Text 3
A Sublime Text 3 Plugin to inject self updating metadata into any document.

Create your own custom stamps! LiveStamps is handy for things like:

  * Inserting metadata in docblock headers, that update automatically.
  * Adding predefined signatures or class header info
  * Tracking file meta no matter where it is moved/renamed
  * The date the document was last modified
  * The user or person who last modified the file.
  * Updating projects with a new email address or URL
  
Stamps can be dynamic (update on save, or key binding) or static, single use values for injection to save time.
