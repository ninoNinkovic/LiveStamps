## USAGE:

Just hit a key combo to inject a stamp, and it will automagically take care of itself! 

Each "livestamp" is handled by regex for auto updating, and also contains a raw value which is static, useful for things like the current filename, path, parent folder or time, etc.

####Defaults key combos are:
```
  super + alt + letter -> inject the stamp
  ctrl  + alt + letter -> inject the stamp's raw value
```
You can see the default stamps by right clicking and exploring the LiveStamps context menu.


## Creating Custom Stamps:

Live stamps are defined within the *LiveStamps.sublime-settings* file in JSON format. The best way to learn is by browsing/modifying the default stamp examples, but here are the details if you really want to get into it 8)

**WARNING**

Regex patterns are powerful expressions!
    
Test your stamp regex online at a site like [www.regexr.com](https://www.regexr.com "Regexr") first!!! An expression that accidentally matches valid code, will instantly replace it. A mistyped pattern that is too "loose" could replace a huge amount of data in a large file, potentially causing data loss...


**Anatomy of a LiveStamp:**

```
'value' : REQUIRED Literal stamp value. The plugin will try to determine "auto" stamps for you

'stamp' : REQUIRED Format string. Stamp value(s) are inserted at tag marker(s) i.e. "{0} {1} {2}"

'regex' : OPTIONAL Python regex pattern. If empty/excluded, the stamp is assumed static.

'parts' : OPTIONAL List for multipart stamps. i.e. "parts": ["name", "email", "link"]

'strft' : OPTIONAL Python strftime() format to apply to a time value i.e. "%d-%m-%Y"

'format': OPTIONAL Python format() to apply to the stamp's value
```


####Basic Static Example: 

A stamp with a constant output.

```json
"mystamp": {
  "value": "An important value i use often while programming",
  "stamp": "{0}",
},

Output: 

An important value i use often while programming
```


####"Live" Stamp Example (with time formatting): 

A live updating stamp to insert the current date.

Note the "auto" value, Which tells LiveStamps to grab the current time. A constant Python time value could be entered as the value as well, allowing a static time inputs.

```json
"date": {
  "value": "auto",
  "strft": "%d-%m-%Y",
  "regex": "@date.+",
  "stamp": "@date        {0}",
},

Output: 

@date        08-03-2015
```


####Multi-part "Live" Stamp Example: 

A live updating stamp made from other stamps.

This stamp would update date portion automatically. Note, for this to stamp to auto update the previous "date" stamp would have to be defined. If the "date" stamp was NOT defined" the output would be:

```
@copyright   (c) TundraTech date
```

However, the stamp would still be "live" because a regex was supplied. A change to any of its values would still cause an auto update, allowing you to enter a static date if desired, instantly updating all existing stamps in a document automatically.

Changing the regex however, would abandon all the the previous stamps. Careful!

```json
"copyright": {
  "value": "(c) TundraTech",
  "parts": ["copyright", "date"],
  "regex": "@copyright.+",
  "stamp": "@copyright   {0} {1}",
},

Output:

@copyright   (c) TundraTech 08-03-2015
```
